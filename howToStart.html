                <h2>Making your first character</h2>
                <p>It's a bit cruel that all of World of Warcraft's toughest decisions are the first ones you'll have to make.
                    Before you can do anything, you'll need to choose a server, character race, and class to play.
                    Sadly, it can take dozens of hours before you realize one or the other isn't a good fit.
                </p>
                 <p>With servers, pick one that has a medium or high population during the times when you'll normally be playing each day.
                     Avoid "New Player" servers and those with "Maximum" population.
                     You want a server with a healthy, established population but you don't want to be stuck in a queue just trying to log in.
                     If you're playing with any friends, just make a character on whatever server they're on or be sure to all agree on a server in advance.</p>
                <p>Once you've decided which server you want to play on, you have to answer an even bigger question: <strong>What class and race are you going to play?</strong></p>
                <p>Each race in World of Warcraft comes with special bonuses towards certain crafting professions and a unique skill only they can use.
                    For example, humans can break out of stun effects while blood elves can silence other players. It's a lot to take in if you like theorycrafting, but don't sweat these differences too much.
                    Above all else, pick a race that you enjoy the fantasy and aesthetic ofâ€”that'll be the single biggest reason you want to keep playing as them.</p>
                <p><strong>If you're playing with friends, make sure everyone picks a race that belongs to the same faction, otherwise you won't be able to play together.</strong></p>
                <p>Picking a class, however, is a much more intimidating problem. World of Warcraft has 12 classes, each having between two to four specializations (called specs) that determine what abilities they have and what role they play in a group.
                    Do you want to lead the party and soak enemy damage as a tank?
                    Want to keep players alive as a healer? Or do you want to pull off insane damage as a damage-dealer (called a DPS)?</p>
                <p>This can all be daunting to decide on before you've even stepped foot in the game. The good news is that any class can freely switch between specializations outside of combat, so even within a given class you can have up to four wildly different playstyles.
                    Again, <strong>I'd recommend first-time players not sweat these details and pick a class that appeals to them</strong>. Many classes have specializations that also change their role in combat, like monks that can be either tanks, healers, or DPS.
                    The mage, warlock, hunter, and rogue are the only classes where all of their specializations are DPS-focused, so keep that in mind if you want to experiment being a tank or healer.</p>
                <p>Here's a quick breakdown of each class:</p>

                <ul>
                   <li><strong>Warriors</strong> are a savage melee class that have one tank spec and two DPS specs. Pick them if you like charging head first into combat. </li>
                    <li><strong>Paladins</strong> are wielders of holy magic that they channel in melee combat and can be either a tank, healer, or DPS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hunters</strong> can be either a melee DPS or ranged DPS and they can also tame wild animals to fight alongside them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rogues</strong> are purebred melee DPS with a knack for trickery, stealth, and insane bursts of damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Priests</strong> have two very different healing specs or they can tap into the powers of shadow to deal impressive damage as a ranged DPS class.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shamans</strong> are masters of the elements, calling down lightning and fire upon their enemies. They can be ranged DPS, melee DPS, and healers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mages</strong> are master spellslingers that use fire, frost, or arcane energy to attack enemies as ranged DPS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Warlocks</strong> channel fire and shadow magics as a pure ranged DPS class. They can also summon demons to fight for them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monks</strong> are unparalleled pugilists who call upon the Mists to aid them in battle as healers, melee DPS, and tanks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Druids</strong> shapeshift into different animal forms and are the most versatile class with four separate specs: melee DPS, ranged DPS, tanks, and healers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demon Hunters</strong> are highly mobile melee specialists that channel demonic energy to power their attacks. They can be either melee DPS or tanks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Death Knights</strong> are freed servants of the Lich King and wield powerful runeblades as either melee DPS or tanks.</li>
                </ul>
